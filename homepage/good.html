              I'm Dalton Ronan, a Computing Science After Degree student at the University of Alberta in Edmonton,
              Alberta, Canada. I'm interested in a career in software engineering, particularly full-stack web
              development.<br><br>
              When I'm not internally screaming at JavaScript, I love to spend my time in the Rocky Mountains
              hiking, camping, and fly fishing.

        <h2>Professional History</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            In my previous degree, I gained experience with scientific programming languages Python and MatLab, and
            gained experience and comfort working with Linux. I began exploring software engineering when I was hired as
            a part-time Python developer, developing Juptyer notebooks for Alberta Education as part of the Callysto
            project.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my Computing Science degree, I completed a client-based project developing a web app on the MERN
            stack. I was also fortunate enough to have the opportunity to TA two courses: CMPUT 301 and CMPTU 401, both
            software engineering courses which taught me a great deal in both hard and soft skills like Agile software
            development, Java, JavaScript, React, Django, and MongoDB.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2021, I completed a summer internship as a Full Stack Developer working on a React, TypeScript Node,
            GraphQL and MySQL stack. Following my internship, I was hired by the company as a part-time Jr. Full Stack
            Developer where I continue to work as I finish my final year of school.
